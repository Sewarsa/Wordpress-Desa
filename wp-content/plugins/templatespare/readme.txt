== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are all of the starter templates completely free? =

Many more premium website demos are available when you purchase one of our [All Themes Plan Bundles](https://afthemes.com/all-themes-plan/) or any individual [Premium Theme](https://afthemes.com/products/category/pro/) that you wish to import demo websites from. 

= Is Templatespare compatible with my theme? =

All of themes for our starter websites will be downloaded immediately from [AF themes](https://afthemes.com/starter-sites/). However, in the near future, we may work on additional themes compatibility.

= Is it necessary to install any other plugins before importing a website? =

Simply install the Templatespare plugin and pick the website demo you want to import. While the site is being imported, you will reach to a process where the plugin will install and activate the essential themes and plugins.

To avoid resetting and overriding settings and page design, install and import a website demo on a new WordPress installation or a blank website.
